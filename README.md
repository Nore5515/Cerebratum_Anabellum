# Cerebratum_Anabellum
Cerebratum, brought back for hopefully the last time.


An RTS where YOU play as one of the soldiers! Design your base, fight for resources and lead the charge as any one of your units!


## NoPathBarrier Prefab
Place these invisible colliders wherever you DON'T want paths drawn! If someone tries to draw a path over it, it will immediately terminate the path.

PRO TIP: Place it JUST beneath the surface, expanded so that it fully engulfs the terrain the units walk on. This will guarentee paths drawn on the terrain.

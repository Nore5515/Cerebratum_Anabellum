You've been hired out to the small southern nation of Sandsyl, which may not exist in a few moments, given that their capital is currently being invaded by their northern (and much scarier) neighbor, Iryllia. Sandsyl has paid us SIGNIFICANT sums of money to ensure that they stick around, so Corporate wants you to help lead their defense. You'll do great, newbie!"
